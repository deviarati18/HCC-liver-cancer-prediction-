# HCC-liver-cancer-prediction-

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer worldwide, that causes the death of about 600,000 patients every year. Patients with HCC have rare chances of survival. The chances of survival increase, if the cancer is diagnosed early. The use of machine learning for HCC survival prediction is motivated by two key factors – enhancing the patient’s quality of life with a quick and accurate diagnosis, and identifying relevant features to improve accuracy of the prediction model. Dimensionality reduction-based methods have shown state-of-the-art performance on many disease detection problems, which motivates the development of machine learning models based on reduced features dimension. The objective of this work is to determine the best combination of dimensionality reduction and optimization technique for classification of the data. Experimental results on publicly available HCC dataset indicate that a combination of PCA-GA-SVM shows improvement in the HCC prediction accuracy, with reduced computational time, considering a reduced dataset. Apart from performance improvement, the proposed method also shows lower complexity from two aspects, i.e., reduced processing time in terms of hyperparameters optimization and training time. The proposed method achieved accuracy of 75.61% and AUC of 0.7548.
